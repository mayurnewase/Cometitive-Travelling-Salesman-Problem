# Cometitive-Travelling-Salesman-Problem

This is project for solving Compititive travelling salesman problem by using hyperheuristic methods.

Setup:-

      install python 2.x or 3.x
      install python library "tkinter". used for developing applications in gui.
      install python library "pandas". used for managing data from csv files.

Files info:-

1.Dataset and Environment:-

      dataset.csv file -> Contains dataset
      environent.py -> Environment for 2 agents,controlled using listeners.

2.Connection Demo:-
      
      client.py -> Demo file for basic client-server communication.
      
3.Heuristic methods:-(under developement->Final check remaining)
      
      nearest_neighbour.py -> Logic for controlling agent using NN.
      random_neighbour.py ->Logic for controlling agent using RN.
      aggressive_neighbour.py ->Logic for controlling agent using aggressive heuristic.
      

To Do:-
      
      Before going for Hyper-heuristic,check everything works correctly.
