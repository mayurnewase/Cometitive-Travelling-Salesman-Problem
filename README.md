# Cometitive-Travelling-Salesman-Problem

This is project for solving Compititive travelling salesman problem by using hyperheuristic methods.

Changelog:-
	
      Aggressive heuristic method completed.
      2-opt completed.

Setup:-

      install python 2.x or 3.x
      install python library "tkinter". used for developing applications in gui.
      install python library "pandas". used for managing data from csv files.

Files info:-

1.Dataset and Environment:-

      dataset.csv file -> Contains dataset
      environent.py -> Environment for 2 agents,controlled using listeners.

2.Connection Demo:-
      
      client.py -> Demo file for basic client-server communication.
      
3.Heuristic methods:-(under developement->Final check remaining)
      
      nearest_neighbour.py -> Logic for controlling agent using Nearest Neighbour heuristic.
      random_neighbour.py ->Logic for controlling agent using Random Neighbour heuristic.
      2opt.py -> Logic for controlling agent using 2-opt heuristic.
      aggressive_neighbour.py ->Logic for controlling agent using aggressive heuristic.

4.Test-bed:-
	
      It's used for testing standalone heuristic method on single agent.

To Do:-
      
      Before going for Hyper-heuristic,check everything works correctly.
